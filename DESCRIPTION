MRCS-Buckeroo

Model Railroad projects often require one or more power supplies for lighting and electronics powered from an 
auxilliary powr bus, usually 12VDC or a local "wall wart" power supply.  Commercial bucking supplies based on
LM 2596 or boosters based on XL6009 offere an inexpensive basis for developing any voltage from 3-35 volts with 
an input of 3-25 volts by choosing and adjusting an appropriate module.  

The Buckeroo has a 2.1 x 5.5 mm barrel connector and a 3.5mm screw terminal for input and 12 x 0.100 terminals 
power and ground out.  You may also use it as a power distribution block for layout bus power or a wall wart 
without further conversion by omitting the converter and jumpering around its pads.
